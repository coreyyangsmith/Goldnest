{/* [ACCOUNTS] will be the place where you can track your net worth and update new accounts.
    This data will be fed into your dashboard and reports section.
    Accounts may consist of:
    - Chequings/Savings accounts
    - Investment Accounts (Stock, potentially dividends, HISA, GICs, other fixed incomes)
    - Other Assets that contribute to NW
    
    - This being said, when you create new entries, they will not be tied to accounts, in fact
    entries will only be tied to your budget and serve as an I/O summary. They will essentially
    be two separate aspects of your finance (Macro vs Micro)
